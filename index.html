          <h1> The era when research evolved towards delving into one's soul <br> <br> </h1>
        <p> The Romantic age was relatively special for it’s time, the age prior to this one was called the Enlightenment and was heavily focused on science and the advancement of one’s own mind. The huge difference between these are shown in how the Romantic age was more about imagination, emotions and the study of nature.
          <br> <br>
This age of literature was highly focused on delving into yourself and acquiring knowledge of your own soul and mind. This was an entirely new concept to many as most viewed science as being the act of dissection and knowledge through scientific studies. This created a clear difference between the prior ages and the Romantic age, turning people from scientists into more of nature enthusiasts.
<br> <br>
People in the Romantic age also valued the insight into one’s past as it was seen as an important part of the person and that their experiences turned them into the human beings they are today. Just like how a prior experience could influence your actions and personality.
 <br> <br>
In conclusion, the Romantic age was about how one’s own feelings and our own souls were the most important scientific study that could ever be conducted. This scientific study could effectively get conducted through the careful study of nature. Through the study of nature, one’s past, one’s soul, and one’s self, they could then try to pinpoint our human nature. Given that they knew all of the different ways we existed and operated in, they tried to create a deeper understanding of the soul, and maybe even consciousness itself. Another important part of the period was the authors, so who were they?

    <h1> The great young authors of the romantic era <br> <br> </h1>
      <p>    1. Mary Shelley <br> <br>
        Mary Shelley (1797-1851) was the daughter of two famous writers and thinkers. She was brought up by her father and his intellectual circles. She met her future husband in one of these circles. The 5 years older man P.B Shelley and Mary ran from england and travelled around Europe until they ended up at George Gordon Byron’s place near Lake Geneva. Lord Byron had an idea that the people at his residence would compete in a ghost story competition. Mary had a nightmare after a while and her well-known book Frankenstein was created from that nightmare. <br> <br>

<h1> Why is Edgar Allan Poe so known? </h1>
<br><br>
  <p>As you have read Poe lived a very sad life, losing his parents at the age of 2. Getting into a gambling addiction which led him into dropping out of the university. Then later on being forced to join the military because of poverty. Drinking being the reason to his death at the age of 40.
The biggest downfall of them all- His Wife Virgina Eliza Clemm Poe's death. Why is he so goddamn well-known in the English speaking world? Well that is a great question!
Edgar Allan Poe's stories left a mark on the history of literature. What makes him stand out? Well, it was because of his style and form. He basically identified the key components to make anyone want a read his stories.<br><br>

  <li> You could read his story in just one sitting which means that you didn’t have to “waste time” as you youngsters say, on reading. You could just sit on the bus and read it.</li><br><br>

    <li> Make EVERY word contribute to the story and the purpose of it. Because you don’t want to waste your time neither reading unnecessary words like you are doing right now.</li><br><br>

Mr.Poe slayed these techniques and became a master at it, and therefore rewarded the readers with the adrenaline of their life. He called this ”unity of effect”. This effect does not only mess with fear! Mr.Poe used horror and violence to explore and find more about mysteries of grief, guilt and love in the same time also sending out small hints of supernatural elements. The true darkness behind this is that he was exploring the darkness of a human being’s mind and its propensity.<br><br>

 Edgar Allan Poe may be known for his horror stories but he was actually one of the most experimental authors during Romanticism, believe it or not. He invented the detective mystery genre as we know of. The Book “The Mystery of Marie Roget” was one of his first books in the mystery genre.

<br><br>There are many other poems and short stories that Edgar Allan Poe has written, but if I would have made a list or write about them you would have already scrolled past it all or left the page.

<br><br>If only Mr. Poe knew how many psycho writers he has inspired such as Stephen King and readers he has damaged- I believe that would bring a smile to his miserable face.
