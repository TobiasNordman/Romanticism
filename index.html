          <h1> The era when research evolved towards delving into one's soul <br> <br> </h1>
        <p> The Romantic age was relatively special for it’s time, the age prior to this one was called the Enlightenment and was heavily focused on science and the advancement of one’s own mind. The huge difference between these are shown in how the Romantic age was more about imagination, emotions and the study of nature.
          <br> <br>
This age of literature was highly focused on delving into yourself and acquiring knowledge of your own soul and mind. This was an entirely new concept to many as most viewed science as being the act of dissection and knowledge through scientific studies. This created a clear difference between the prior ages and the Romantic age, turning people from scientists into more of nature enthusiasts.
<br> <br>
People in the Romantic age also valued the insight into one’s past as it was seen as an important part of the person and that their experiences turned them into the human beings they are today. Just like how a prior experience could influence your actions and personality.
 <br> <br>
In conclusion, the Romantic age was about how one’s own feelings and our own souls were the most important scientific study that could ever be conducted. This scientific study could effectively get conducted through the careful study of nature. Through the study of nature, one’s past, one’s soul, and one’s self, they could then try to pinpoint our human nature. Given that they knew all of the different ways we existed and operated in, they tried to create a deeper understanding of the soul, and maybe even consciousness itself. Another important part of the period was the authors, so who were they?

    <h1> The great young authors of the romantic era <br> <br> </h1>
      <p>    1. Mary Shelley <br> <br>
        Mary Shelley (1797-1851) was the daughter of two famous writers and thinkers. She was brought up by her father and his intellectual circles. She met her future husband in one of these circles. The 5 years older man P.B Shelley and Mary ran from england and travelled around Europe until they ended up at George Gordon Byron’s place near Lake Geneva. Lord Byron had an idea that the people at his residence would compete in a ghost story competition. Mary had a nightmare after a while and her well-known book Frankenstein was created from that nightmare. <br> <br>
             2. Jane Austen <br> <br>
             Jane Austen (1775-1817) was not a typical Romantic writer. Her Novels are closer to our times “Rom-coms” than the other famous novels from her time. Austen was raised in a relatively large family of 9 people in the town of Steventon, Hampshire. She wrote stories to amuse her family while she was young but she started to write novels at the age of 20. Her most famous novel Pride and Prejudice was published in 1813. (Fun Fact) None of her books contain any kissing.
