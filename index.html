The French Revolution is one of the most iconic events of romanticism. The Revolution started on the 5th of May 1789 when people started taking up arms against the ruling monarchy to claim power. The main cause for the Revolution was predominantly the high increase of taxation and the debt of France and bad harvest by the grain industry that followed up in these times. It led the people to revolt with the nobility against King Louis XVI which resulted in his execution by 1793.

During the French Revolution, a man named Napoleon Bonaparte rose to power by climbing the military ranks. He claimed power in 1799 in a coup d’état and crowned himself as the emperor. The Revolution had spillovers that affected the nations surrounding France in big scale; it spread to the Caribbean and even reached the Middle East. French citizens had the pleasures of a secular and democratic republic with citizen rights, but the way the country was ruled was not very democratic. It would shift more towards autocratic authoritarian and militaristic outlook ideologies, and that led to the French revolutionary wars which started on 20th April 1792. The Revolution sparked and took Europe by storm. The war was conducted between two alliances: Great Britain, Kingdom of France, Holy Roman Empire, Spain, Dutch republic, Portugal, Sardinia and Naples were on the first alliance and were supporting King Louis XIV’s rule. They wanted to suppress the revolution and some of them even came to regret their decision and switched sides. For example, Spain joined the second alliance in 1796 which consisted of Republic of France, Spain, Batavian republic, Sister republics and the Polish legions. The war lasted for more than 5 years and ended with the victory of the French republic and a significant change in the geo-political map of Europe, including the annexation of several territories into the French land. Many countries got vassalized and ‘puppet’ regimes were installed. These were one of the major changes that later led on the French republic into acquiring a bigger influence in Europe. With Napoleon in charge and France being the center of attention in Europe at that period, the Napoleonic Wars formed numerous coalitions and many attacks to seize control in various lands in Europe turned out to be successful for the French side.

The Fifth Coalition was formed and France entered a war with Russia. They reached Moscow and Russia had not surrendered which went against Napoleon's expectations. The French army retreated back and suffered thousands of deaths of its soldier to attrition alone. Napoleon was exiled to the island of Elba and that was the last of his successful attempts to take control which marked the end of the most iconic event of 18th century.
