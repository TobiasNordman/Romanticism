                <p>Edgar Allan Poe was an American writer, poet, critic and editor. He was born on 19 January 1809 in Boston, Massachusetts and died 7 October 1849. So he lived his life until he turned 40 years old. When he was 2 years old both his mother and father died and he had to go into the home of John Allan who is his godfather and of his childless wife. After some years when he was about 6 to 11 years old, he was taken to Scotland and England. There he has received a classic education in Richmond, Virginia. Later on, in 1826 he went to The University of Virginia and were there for about 11 months. During the school year, he lost a lot of money due to games, horses, firearms, tobacco and alcohol. After a while, he realized that he could not pay back so he chose to leave the University of Virginia and went to Richmond find his true love who is Elmira Royster engaged. In 1836 he married his cousin Virginia who was 13 years old while Poe was 25 years old. When Virginia was 24 years old she died from tuberculosis.

One of his famous works is The Raven which is a poem he published on 29 January 1845. The poem was about a man who grieves because of the loss if his significant other. While Poe wrote this poem his wife Virgina was suffering from tuberculosis and he didn't really care as he did when his brother, mother and foster mother because he does not love his wife that deeply. After he published his poem everyone liked it. Everytime Poe went down the street to go somewhere there were children who recognized him and started to follow him while flapping their arms and cawing just disturb his peace. He would get very irritated and turned around and shouted “NEVERMORE” at the children and they would run away for fear.
