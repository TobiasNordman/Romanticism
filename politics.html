                <h2> <center> How wole of women were in the age of Romanticism </center> </h2>
                    <br>

                <p> During the romantic period, the rights of men and women have changed in a positive way. Especially for women. At that time it was not like during the age of Enlightenment that women were not allowed in some places like coffee shops, but throughout the romantic period women are allowed to get into coffee shops and they do not have to only work at home. They can now go outside and find a job.  

Even though the rights of women has changed in a positive way for women, men still have hate towards women. At that time women were seen as “pure” and everyone expected them to be the “ideal woman” concept arose. If a woman had lost her virginity before marriage, she would be seen as a such called “fallen woman” and would be cut off by society because such behavior was not okay during the romantic period. That is not the only thing women could not do without being hated or cut off by their society. They could not, for example, write texts or books. There were many women who wrote books and were afraid to write their names under the text because it was not legal for women to do such a thing like that. So the women who were authors had to write under their text with a male name so people would not know that a woman wrote the text. This has happened to many female authors, for example, the Brontë sisters of the UK who had to write their name under the text with male names to avoid people who unfairly criticized their work because of their gender. 

As you can see by changing the rights of women did not really help them. They are still struggling and cannot do whatever they want to and that is pretty sad. They cannot vote because they have not the right to do it and whenever they are getting married it is always the women who get the most responsibilities and has lower individual rights than their husband. That is just greatly unequal. Some of the unfair things were that the husband could just lean back and relax while the wife had to do everything for him and anything the wife would bring to the marriage automatically belonged to the husband. He did not care if it was her property or a piece of jewelry that she received from her grandparents as a memory of them. The worst part is that before a woman marries to a man the family of the woman has to pay a sum of money to the man for taking her. That is just pure objectifying women.
