      <p id="h2one"> Out of the many technological advancements made during the romantic period I think the two most prominent were the invention of the battery, and the invention of Morse code telegraphy. According to Wikipedia (Jan, 2019); the battery was invented in the beginning of the 1800’s by an Italian physicist by the name of Alessandro Volta, and had a huge effect on how technology works today. The battery created in the 1800’s was very basic but given time to evolve it has now turned out to be a critical invention which affected society greatly. <br><br>

      According to The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica (Jan, 2019); Morse code on the other hand was not created as an invention but more as a language at which people could converse with the most simple of machinery. Morse code was created by an American man named Samuel F.B. Morse. Morse code is a language which consists of dots and dashes and has mostly been used to convey messages over long distances, especially in the military. One could quickly tell that the technology of this period was not highly complicated, but it was a start point to technological advances worldwide. <br><br>

      According to Wikipedia (Dec, 2018); during the romantic period there were many advances in politics, arts, and culture. With these advances being anything between a new kind of nationalism to many different arts and art styles. But during this important period when it comes to art and literature, there were also many huge changes which helped change the way science was seen through the eyes of the people of the 19th-century. <br><br>

      The enlightenment’s reductionism, the act of “dissecting” an object or nature philosophical study to understand the bits and parts as to why it turned out to be as it did. This was the way the previous period had worked on attaining knowledge of nature. This was instead during the romantic era seen as the scientists taking the knowledge by force, as explained by Wikipedia (Jan, 2019). <br><br>

      The scientists of this era believed in that one could attain more knowledge through the slow careful studying of nature itself. This led to a belief in epistemological optimism, that man was in fact connected to nature through a strong bond. This led to the perception of that a scientist knew more about both man and nature through the study of one of them. This led them to believe that there was a possibility of salvation through the contemplation of nature. This led scientists to focus even further on learning of the way nature worked which gave biology a huge push towards the direction which it is in today. <br><br>
